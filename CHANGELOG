v3.1.1 (2022-11-15)
- Fix ID3v2 version parsing bug

v3.1 (2022-11-4)
- Added support for Musepack format
- Added support for HE-AAC, xHE-AAC formats
- Added option '-S' to skip files with existing ReplayGain data
- Easy mode: Added tag mode 'n' which will always skip files regardless of whether or not they have existing ReplayGain tags
- Always fail if a requested command line option or scan preset is invalid
- Build binary packages via GitHub Actions CI
- Added support for BSD operating systems

v3.0.1 (2022-10-13)
- Fixed inconsistencies in tab output formatting

v3.0 (2022-9-14)
- Massive internal rewrite:
    - Source code is now purely C++ instead of mixed C/C++
    - Text formating and output now utilize the fmt library, which is safer and typically faster than C stdio implementations
- Easy Mode multithreaded now generates scan jobs per-directory instead of per-file, which provides an approximately 15-20% performance boost due to reduced thread idling time
- Added progress updates for Easy Mode multithreaded
- Added -m MAX option to use the maximum concurrent threads value provided by the OS
- Fixed a critical bug inherited from loudgain where the program segfaults when trying to delete tags from M4A or WMA files
- Added -t option which allows users to choose between sample peak and true peak for peak calculations. Sample peak now default in both Easy Mode and Custom Mode
- Added -O option in Easy Mode which outputs a .csv spreadsheet scan log in every scanned directory
- Added more statistics to Easy Mode output
- Write uppercase tags by default for all tag types in Easy Mode
- Optimized scan progress bar, resulting in significant speed boost for Windows single threaded scanning
- "Overrides" feature renamed "Preset"
  - Specified with -p instead of -o
  - Support preset name as argument, which will automatically find the preset in the predetermined location(s) per platform
  - Support "Global" section in preset, which allows the user to specify settings for all formats to reduce duplication
  - Changed the name of setting keys in accordance with command line flags
  - Ship EBU R 128 preset and "loudgain" preset based on rgbpm settings
- Removed tag modes that enabled non-standard behavior:
  - -s e mode which wrote non-standard REPLAYGAIN_REFERENCE_LOUDNESS and REPLAYGAIN_*_RANGE tags
  - -s l mode which wrote non-standard LU units to *_GAIN tags instead of dB
- Changed how target loudness is specified:
  - Removed -d option which specified a "pre-gain" from -18 LUFS
  - Replaced with -l option which allows the user to specify the target loudness directly in LUFS
- Write ID3v2.3 tags by default in Custom Mode
- Changed clipping protection:
  - Now specified with -c and 3 choice character option instead of a boolean
  - Old -k functionality is now -c a
  - New -c p functionality only provides clipping protection for positive gain values, which is now the default in Easy Mode
- Removed strip tags option (-S)
- Changed max peak level command line char from -K to -m
- Changed behavior for Opus files:
  - Introduced -o option with required char argument
  - Support writing to header output gain
  - default 'd' mode: Write standard ReplayGain tags, set output gain to 0
  - 'r' mode: Write RFC 7845 R128_*_GAIN tags, set output gain to 0
  - 't' and 'a' modes write the track gain and album gain to the header output gain, respectively
  - Keep default loudness at -18 LUFS (can be changed with -l option)
- Windows: Added resource file containing VERSIONINFO
- Windows: Support static linking of dependencies
- Linux: Enforce a minimum taglib version 1.12. Provide a static taglib build for the .deb package

v2.0.1 (2022-5-18)
- Set max thread sleep period to prevent hanging in multithreaded mode

v2.0 (2022-5-10)
- Changed project name to rsgain
- Added "Easy Mode" with recursive directory scanning. Old command line syntax now known as "Custom Mode"
- Added multithreaded scanning
- Added override feature for Easy Mode

v1.0.1 (2022-4-15)
- Refactored scan.py script, renamed to loudgain-scanner.py
- Strictly enforce libebur128 minimum version 1.2.4

v1.0 (2022-2-21)
- Fork from Moonbase59/loudgain v0.6.8
- Native Windows port
